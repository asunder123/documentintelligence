## ✅ What Problems Does This Solve?

The Decision Intelligence UI helps address structural gaps in documented decision-making without relying on inference or black-box AI. Here are the key problems it solves:

1.  **Decision Coverage Gaps**
    *   Detect where documented causes do **not** lead to actions or outcomes.
    *   Surface incomplete chains (cause-only or action-only) that signal unresolved issues.

2.  **Decision Debt Analysis**
    *   Quantify “decision debt” (structural gaps in problem-to-action linkage).
    *   Highlight broken chains for governance and remediation planning.

3.  **Context-Wise Maturity Comparison**
    *   Compare decision-making maturity across projects, teams, or domains.
    *   Benchmark action and outcome coverage to prioritize improvement areas.

4.  **Unified Action Recommendation (Deterministic)**
    *   Aggregate structural signals (coverage, support, constraints, debt) to recommend the most robust next action.
    *   Provide transparent scorecards and evidence for auditability.

5.  **Governance & Audit Readiness**
    *   Export deterministic rankings of actions for compliance reviews.
    *   Enable leadership to validate decisions without relying on opaque AI inference.

6.  **Root Cause → Action → Outcome Traceability**
    *   Visualize causal chains for clarity in retrospectives and RCA sessions.
    *   Improve accountability by linking actions to documented causes and outcomes.

7.  **Operational Efficiency & Risk Reduction**
    *   Reduce delays caused by missing or unclear decisions.
    *   Surface structural weaknesses before they lead to operational failures.

### Real-World Examples

*   **IT Operations**: Reduce MTTR by spotting missing corrective actions in incident chains.
*   **Compliance**: Close decision gaps in regulated processes for audit readiness.
*   **Project Governance**: Rank actions based on structural evidence for better prioritization.
*   **Continuous Improvement**: Identify patterns of unresolved issues across multiple contexts.
